### **Andrew’s Lucky Delay**  (AI generated text.)

Andrew sighed, staring at the empty tracks. The last train was late.  

“Guess we’re both stuck,” said a voice beside him. A woman smiled, her scarf fluttering in the wind.  

They chatted—about missed trains, late nights, and favorite books. Laughter warmed the cold air.  

When the train finally arrived, Andrew almost wished it hadn’t.  

“Same time tomorrow?” she asked.  

He grinned. “Definitely.”  

Sometimes, delays lead to the best destinations.
